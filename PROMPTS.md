# Development Prompts

Key prompts used during development.

## Setup
- "cloudflare workers typescript setup"
- "wrangler configuration for durable objects"
- "workers ai llama model documentation"

## Implementation
- "call workers ai from cloudflare worker"
- "durable objects state management example"
- "create REST API endpoint in workers"
- "fetch conversation history from durable object"

## Debugging
- "wrangler.toml workflows binding syntax error"
- "durable object not persisting state"
- "cors headers cloudflare workers"
- "workers.dev subdomain setup"

The workflow configuration kept throwing errors so I simplified the implementation to call the AI directly from the handler.
